                <h1>Why Ultrawide?</h1>

                <p>Those of us with big feet (I'm a US 13) know that toe and heel drag is a big issue, especially if you want to lay out your carves.</p>

                <p>How does an ultrawide compare?</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Normal: 25.5cm</li>
                    <li>Wide: 26.5cm</li>
                    <li>Ultrawide: 28cm +</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Finding a big board is tough. Most manufacturers don't make ultrawide boards, and those that do bury the boards in their lineup.</p>

                <p>This website is a list of every 2021-2022 ultrawide board available that is at least 27.5cm wide at the waist and 155cm or longer. Since almost every board comes in multiple sizes, I'm only listing the widest and longest variant. You'd never ride anything smaller, right?</p>

                <p>If you're not 6'2" with a size 13 foot or larger this site is not for you. You'll do fine with a regular sized board.</p>

                <p>Some people like to overcome a narrow board by widening their stance, angling their feet more, getting risers, getting smaller boots, or just ignoring it. Those don't work for me, and they hurt. Shouldn't big guys have an opportunity to ride big boards?</p>

                <p>Choosing the right board size is tough. Here are some useful resources:</p>

                <h1>What's new in 2021-2022?</h1>

                <p>Honestly, not much has changed. The choices are still very limited, and some suppliers like Never Summer, Jones, and Nidecker have dropped ultrawide models. Others, like Korua, have added a few more. Deviation Works, Cardiff Snowcraft, SG Snowboards, Dupraz Snow, and Stranda have entered the ultrawide market this year.</p>

                <p>The market remains saturated with short, wide, directional boards. There aren't that many choices for a long (170+) twin board without moving to a custom design.</p>

                <p>A few brands are very slow with updating their website. We'll add them once the 2021-2022 lineup is announced.</p>

                <p>Most brands hide their ultrawide snowboards, but a few have dedicated marketing for what they consider wide (note that some of them are in the 26cm range): <a href="https://www.neversummer.com/how-to-choose-a-snowboard/" target="_blank">Never Summer DF series</a>, <a href="https://www.lib-tech.com/snowboard/mens-snowboards?snowboard_width=948" target="_blank">Lib Tech ultra-wide</a>, <a href="https://www.jonessnowboards.com/content/241-wide-snowboards-and-splitboards-big-feet-big-horn-series" target="_blank">Jones Big Horn Series</a>, <a href="http://www.ltbsnowboards.com/snowboards?fi[20]=57-45" target="_blank">LTB XW and XXW</a>.</p>
