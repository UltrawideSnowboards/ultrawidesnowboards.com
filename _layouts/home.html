<h1>Ultrawide Snowboards</h1>

<p>Those of us with big feet (I'm a US 13) know that toe and heel drag is a big issue, especially if you want to do Knapton style carves.</p>

<p>An ultrawide board is one that's over 28cm wide at the waist. Most boards are aronud 25cm, "wide" boards are typically around 26.5cm.</p>

<p>Finding a big board is tough. Most manufacturers don't make ultrawide boards, and those that do bury the boards.</p>

<p>This website is a list of every ultrawide board I've found. Since almost every board comes in multiple sizes, I'm only listing the widest and longest variant. You'd never ride anything smaller, right?</p>

<p>If you're not 6'2" with a size 13 foot or larger this site is not for you.</p>

<p>Some people like to overcome a narrow board by widening their stance, angling their feet more, getting risers, or just ignoring it. I'm of a different mind: I think a wider board will let you ride more naturally.</p>
